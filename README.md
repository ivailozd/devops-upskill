# devops-upskill

Final project - [Upskill DevOps](https://www.telerikacademy.com/upskill/devops)

This repo introduces CI in the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching strategy. 
The aim is to guarantee the delivered software's quality and make the deployment to the test and production environment easier by:
- automation of the unit testing
- automation of the static code analysis
- automation of the dependency vulnerability check
- automation of the artifact's building and deployment
- automation of the container's building and deployment
